# Challenge 5 - Powering up the Food Storage and Processing Equipment 

The Food Storage and Processing Equipment (FSPE) serves as a pivotal component for sustaining the crew during their stay. The system combines storage, meal selection, and preparation functionalities. Its primary purpose is to provide the crew with a reliable and efficient means of managing their food supplies, ensuring optimal nutrition and well-being throughout their lunar mission. 

The crew members can easily select meals from a menu, triggering the machine to process and prepare food items, taking into account individual preferences. The machine boasts features such as water usage management, emergency food supply access, and nutritional information availability.

The FSPE exhibits a robust physical design and HMI so that it can be operated even in harsh physical environments, such as low temperature or air pressure.
