# Challenge 1 - Making your lunar rover operational 

Your Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV) was transported to the landing spot during a preceding robotic mission. Make the rover operational according to the correct procedure.

Due to a communication failure during landing, you are only provided with a continuous string of text by your mission control. Break it up into separate words and a meaningful sequence of task steps.

The passcode for the next task can be compiled from the initial characters of the task steps.
