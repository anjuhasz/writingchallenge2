# Challenge 4 - Getting the LSHM into use again

Now, you finally enter the habitat through an airlock and remove your dusty and worn spacesuits. 

The Lunar Surface Habitat Module (LSHM) can accommodate a crew of two for a mission lasting two weeks and includes two crew cabins, a kitchen, a hygiene facility, a workspace, and a laboratory. It is fitted with an environmental control and monitoring system and enclosed storage for waste and wastewater.

Now, your task is to check the conditions of the Life Support System one by one and put them back into use so that youâ€™ll be able to survive your prolonged stay on the surface of the Moon.

Study the damaged manual of the Life Support System (LSS). 
Break it into meaningful parts, keeping the order of the elements.

Find out the missing pieces of text for the key elements of the LSS (whose order is mixed up) and match them to the respective description. 
Compile a passkey from the initial capital letters of the LSS elements.
