# Storyline

In 2078, a recent but failed private mining mission to the Moon got you stranded on the surface of our celestial companion. Your moon descent/ascent unit (MDAU) was damaged to the extent that you are unable to use it to leave the surface or use its life supplies.

A rescue mission will be dispatched from Earth soon, but it takes four weeks for them to land.

Your only chance for survival is to reach the abandoned Artemis Base Camp station - built in the early 2030s as part of the Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program but vacated in the mid-2040s - and enter it for shelter and life support.

Your Mission Control has managed to find the original instructions for the Artemis Base Camp, but they are in an old, compressed, and hardly convertible format. Conversion has resulted in damaged and hardly readable text. 

Your thread of life now depends on your skills of how you can decipher and reconstruct those damaged pieces of text.

The challenge comprises the following types of tasks :

* Break up continuous strings of text into meaningful chunks
* Re-assemble/re-order the scattered parts.
* Guess and write the missing parts (parts of words, full words, etc.).
* Put the instructions in the right order.

Pieces of input will be available in a dedicated GitHub repository in password-protected files. As parts of the tasks, some codes/strings need to be deciphered from the reconstructed texts, so that they can be entered as passwords for the next task.

Though radio communication is unreliable due to damaged equipment, teams may occasionally be able to establish contact with the „Mission Control” for intermittent help.

The mission comprises the following challenges:

1. Make your lunar rover operational according to the correct procedure.
2. Reach the Artemis Base Camp at the lunar south pole around the Shackleton Crater.
   Your task is to enter the right Moon coordinates into your rover's computer.
3. Open the gates of the Surface Habitat Module with the right code, according to the right instructions.
4. Re-pressurize the airlock vacuum chamber according to the right procedure. Re-assemble the scattered instructions.
5. Re-initialize the infrastructure operating systems of the Surface Habitat Module of the base camp.
6. Re-assemble the operating instructions for the food storage and processing equipment.
7. Reconstruct the troubleshooting  instructions for the food storage and processing equipment to find out and resolve a problem.
