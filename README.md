# Materials for Writing Challenge workshop

Challenge your writing and cooperation skills in an exceptional workshop.

Measure your level of professionalism in an escape room-like exercise in which you work in small groups to solve puzzling writing tasks.

Proceed step-by-step by deciphering and reassembling broken pieces of text to complete your mission in a tight timeframe.

Small groups of 2-3 people will compete in a series of exercises by editing and correcting pieces of text set in a sci-fi plot. Participants will have to save the life of a "shipwrecked" astronaut who got stranded on the Moon in a failed private mining mission.
