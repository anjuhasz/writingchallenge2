# Challenge 2 - Opening the gates of the SHM

A 12-wheeled vehicle kicks up a haze of gunpowder-grey dust as it makes tracks across undulating terrain. After hours of driving, you arrive safely at the Artemis Base Camp. 

Open the gates of the Surface Habitat Module (SHM) according to the instructions in the DOCX file in this folder.

Find out and fill in the missing words. (The context may include clues about the missing words.)

Compile a string from the initial (lowercase) character of each inserted word - in the order you inserted them - to use it as a passcode for the next challenge.
